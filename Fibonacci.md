# Fibonacci Number Problem (DP) üìä

The **Fibonacci sequence** is a classic example of Dynamic Programming.  
It is defined as:

F(0) = 0
F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) for n >= 2

The goal is to compute the `n`th Fibonacci number efficiently.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Top-Down Approach (Memoization)

**Java Code:**

```java
class FibonacciMemoization {
    static int[] memo;

    public static int fib(int n) {
        // Initialize memo array with -1 (not computed)
        memo = new int[n + 1];
        Arrays.fill(memo, -1);
        return helper(n);
    }

    private static int helper(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) return n; // base cases

        if (memo[n] != -1) return memo[n]; // reuse computed value

        // compute and store
        memo[n] = helper(n - 1) + helper(n - 2);
        return memo[n];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 10;
        System.out.println("Fibonacci of " + n + " is " + fib(n));
    }
}
How it works:

Recursively computes fib(n) using fib(n-1) and fib(n-2).

Stores already computed values in the memo array.

Avoids redundant calculations (Overlapping Subproblems).

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n) (recursion stack + memo array)

2Ô∏è‚É£ Bottom-Up Approach (Tabulation)
Java Code:

java
Copy code
class FibonacciTabulation {
    public static int fib(int n) {
        if (n <= 1) return n;

        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        dp[0] = 0;
        dp[1] = 1;

        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
        }

        return dp[n];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 10;
        System.out.println("Fibonacci of " + n + " is " + fib(n));
    }
}
How it works:

Starts with the smallest subproblems (dp[0] = 0, dp[1] = 1).

Iteratively builds up the solution to dp[n].

No recursion is used; it is purely iterative.

Time Complexity: O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n) (can be optimized to O(1) using two variables)

‚úÖ Summary
Method	Time Complexity	Space Complexity	Notes
Memoization (Top-Down)	O(n)	O(n)	Recursive, stores results to avoid recomputation
Tabulation (Bottom-Up)	O(n)	O(n)	Iterative, builds solution from small to large

Key Points:

Memoization is recursive; Tabulation is iterative.

Both avoid redundant calculations.

Great starting point to learn Dynamic Programming.
